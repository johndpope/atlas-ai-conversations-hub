2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
3. **Install GitHub MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add github-server -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
   ```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/speNillusion/atlas-ai-conversations-hub.git

# Enter the directory
cd atlas-ai-conversations-hub

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

## Development with Grok AI

### Using Real Grok API
Configure your Grok API credentials in `variables.json` and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Using Mock Grok Server
For testing without real API authentication, use the mock server:

```bash
# Start development with mock Grok server
pnpm run dev:with-mock

# Or run components separately
pnpm run mock-server  # Start mock server on port 3001
pnpm run dev          # Start main app on port 5173
```

The mock server provides:
- Simulated streaming responses with realistic delays
- Conversation management with unique IDs
- Health check endpoint at `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Full API compatibility for testing
- Browser-compatible implementation using native fetch API

### Testing the Mock Integration

1. Start the development server with mock: `pnpm run dev:with-mock`
2. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Select "Grok AI (Mock)" from the model dropdown
4. Send a test message to see the streaming response simulation
5. Check the browser console for any integration logs

The mock server simulates the real Grok API response structure:
```json
{"result":{"response":{"token":"Hello! ","responseId":"mock-resp-123"}}}
```

### Troubleshooting Grok Integration

If you encounter `MockGrokAPI is not defined` errors:
- Ensure the mock server is running on port 3001
- Check that the browser can access `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Verify the Vite proxy configuration is working
- Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests

## Mobile Build

```bash
# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Add Android platform
npx cap add android

# Sync files
npx cap sync

# Open project in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

```bash
# Check current Claude tasks
gh issue list --label="claude-todo"

# View work in progress
gh issue list --label="claude-in-progress"

# See completed work
gh issue list --label="claude-completed"

# Start working on an issue
gh issue edit 3 --add-label="claude-in-progress" --remove-label="claude-todo"

```

## API Integration

The app supports multiple AI providers:

1. **Groq API** - Fast inference with various models
2. **Google AI** - Integration with Gemini models
3. **Grok AI** - X's AI model with streaming support
4. **Mock Grok** - Testing environment without API costs

Each provider can be selected from the model dropdown in the chat interface.

## UI/UX Design

## Architecture & Recent Improvements

### Browser-Compatible Mock API
The Grok AI integration has been optimized for browser compatibility:

- **SimpleMockGrokAPI**: Custom implementation using browser-native `fetch()` API
- **No Node.js dependencies**: Removed `got-scraping` and other Node.js-specific packages
- **Real-time streaming**: Proper handling of Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Proxy Configuration
The application uses Vite proxy for API routing:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
proxy: {
  '/grok-mock': {
    target: 'http://localhost:3001',
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/grok-mock/, '')
  },
  '/grok-api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:3003',
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/grok-api/, '')
  }
}
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Mock Development**: Use `pnpm run dev:with-mock` for safe testing
2. **Real API Testing**: Configure credentials and use `pnpm run dev`
3. **Chrome Debugging**: Automated Chrome launch with debugging enabled
4. **Hot Reload**: Real-time updates during development
