# Claude Development Guide

## Project Overview
This is an Atlas AI conversations hub built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application features a chat interface with AI model selection, dark mode support, and file upload capabilities.

## Task Management with GitHub Issues

### Why Use GitHub Issues
- **Centralized tracking**: All tasks are visible to the team and easily searchable
- **Persistent history**: Issues remain accessible across sessions
- **Integration**: Links directly to code changes and pull requests
- **Collaboration**: Team members can comment, assign, and track progress

### GitHub Issues Setup

#### 1. Create Personal Access Token
1. Visit: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Name: "Claude MCP Server"
3. Expiration: Choose appropriate duration (90 days recommended)
4. Repository access: Select "Selected repositories" and choose this repo
5. Permissions needed:
   - **Issues**: Read and write
   - **Pull requests**: Read and write
   - **Contents**: Read
   - **Metadata**: Read

#### 2. Configure Environment Variable
Add to your shell configuration file:

```bash
# For zsh users
code ~/.zshrc

# Add this line:
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### 3. Add GitHub MCP Server
```bash
claude mcp add github-server -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Using GitHub Issues for Task Management

- `claude-completed` - Tasks completed by Claude

**Category Labels:**
- `ui-enhancement` - User interface improvements and styling
- `dark-mode` - Dark mode and theming related tasks
- `development-workflow` - Developer tools and workflow improvements

gh issue list --label="claude-completed"

# Start working on an issue (move from todo to in-progress)
gh issue edit 3 --add-label="claude-in-progress" --remove-label="claude-todo"

# Complete an issue (move to completed)
gh issue edit 3 --add-label="claude-completed" --remove-label="claude-in-progress"

# Create new issue with appropriate labels
gh issue create --title "New Feature" --label "claude-todo,ui-enhancement"
```

#### Creating Issues
When starting work on new features or bugs:
```bash
gh issue create --title "Feature: Add dark mode toggle" --label "claude-todo,ui-enhancement" --body "## Summary
Brief description of the task

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Notes

```

#### Issue Templates
Use these templates for different types of work:

**Feature Request:**
```markdown
## Summary

#### Linking Issues to Code
- Reference issues in commit messages: `git commit -m "Fix button styling - closes #5"`
- Link pull requests to issues
- Use GitHub's closing keywords: `closes`, `fixes`, `resolves`

## Development Workflow

### Claude Workflow Instructions ü§ñ

#### Before Starting Work
1. **Check Project Status**: Review Issue #10 (Project Roadmap) for current priorities
2. **Select Issue**: Choose from `claude-todo` labeled issues based on priority
3. **Update Status**: Move issue from `claude-todo` to `claude-in-progress`
4. **Branch Strategy**: Create branch with issue reference: `feature/3-theme-toggle`

#### During Development
1. **Commit Messages**: Reference issue numbers: `git commit -m "Add theme toggle component - addresses #3"`
2. **Progress Updates**: Comment on issues with progress, blockers, or questions
3. **Code Quality**: Follow existing patterns and run lint/typecheck before commits
4. **Testing**: Ensure changes work with existing functionality

#### Completing Work
1. **Acceptance Criteria**: Verify all checklist items are completed
2. **Update Labels**: Move issue from `claude-in-progress` to `claude-completed`
3. **Close Issues**: Use closing keywords in final commit: `closes #3`
4. **Documentation**: Update this file if workflow changes

### 1. Planning Phase
- All work is tracked in GitHub Issues with appropriate labels
- High priority issues should be addressed first
- Break down large features into smaller, manageable issues
- Use the established label system for categorization

### 2. Development Phase
- Reference issue numbers in branch names: `feature/3-theme-toggle`
- Make atomic commits that address specific parts of the issue
- Update issue labels to reflect current status
- Comment on issues with progress and any blockers discovered

### 3. Review Phase
- Create pull requests that reference the issue
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Run quality checks: `pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck`
- Test functionality across different screen sizes and themes

### 4. Completion Phase
- Verify all acceptance criteria are completed
- Update issue labels to `claude-completed`
- Close issues with PR merge using keywords: `closes #3`
- Create follow-up issues for any additional work discovered

## Project Structure

### Key Directories
- `/src/components/` - React components
- `/src/pages/` - Page components
- `/src/contexts/` - React contexts (theme, etc.)
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions
- `/src/i18n/` - Internationalization files

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **CSS custom properties** for theming
- **Dark mode** support via CSS classes
- **Design tokens** for consistent spacing and colors

### Component Patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow React best practices for hooks and state management
- Use React.forwardRef for components that need ref forwarding

## Testing Strategy

### Types of Testing
- **Unit tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Full user workflows
- **Visual regression**: UI consistency

### Testing Tools
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing

## Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build    # Production build
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

### Environment Variables
- Document all required environment variables
- Use `.env.example` file for reference
- Never commit actual API keys or secrets

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error handling
- Write meaningful commit messages

### Performance
- Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Optimize images and assets
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers

### Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check TypeScript errors and dependency versions
2. **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind classes and CSS custom properties
3. **API failures**: Check network requests and error handling
4. **Performance**: Use React DevTools profiler

### Debug Commands
```bash
npm run lint     # Check for linting errors
npm run typecheck # Check TypeScript errors
npm run test     # Run test suite
```
